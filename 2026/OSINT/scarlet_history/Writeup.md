To solve this challenge, you could not examine the exifdata. This was removed purposefully to prevent simple solves from just getting the GPS location. There were two distinct ways of solving this. The first is to reverse image search on google the building, which would come up with a facebook posting listing the actual name for the building(this is not the flag), you would then have to either google what the purpose of this building was which would give the flag, and or utilize the facebook posting to find where the building was located on google maps, as the posting listed the two streets the building was near. With this you would also have needed the prior knowledge listed in the description that this building was in fact at Rutgers University in New Jersey.  The building itself still has its original purpose listed as its name on maps. These were the two main ways to go about solving this challenge.
