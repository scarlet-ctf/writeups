## Description

The flag appeared with a quiet challenge: uncover a place that once mattered. From their screens, the people traced Rutgers University through maps and old records, searching not for what is, but for what was. The building they sought held historical significance for the Scarlet Knights—its walls had witnessed the early rhythm of RU—but time had moved on.

It no longer buzzed with lectures or student life. No offices, no classrooms, nothing housed within it now. Still, its outline remained, preserved in images and archives, a silent marker of Rutgers’ past. Somewhere in that stillness, Sir Henry’s legacy lingered.

With careful OSINT work, the team pinpointed the structure. The map marker dropped, the flag submitted. History, once hidden, had been found again

FLAG FORMAT: `RUSEC{BUILDING_NAME}`

For example, if you find `Hill Center`, the flag would be `RUSEC{HILL_CENTER}`
