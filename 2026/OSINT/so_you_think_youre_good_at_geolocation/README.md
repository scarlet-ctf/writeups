Flag: `RUSEC{makers.interesting.mystic}`

## Description
It's 2032, and ransomware gangs have started breaking their imprisoned members out. The latest incident? Scattered Spider hit some ICS in SeaTac, and now North America's most wanted cybercriminal is back on the run. Better yet, he's taunting authorities by posting selfies while hiking on vacation, obfuscating his photos with not one, but two coats of Nano Banana. It doesn't matter, though, because he's left enough detail that you'll find him anyway. Navigate to what3words.com and find the map cell containing the rail crossing in post.png (do not use the satellite imagery mode to select the cell).

FLAG FORMAT: `RUSEC{word.word.word}`

For example, if the location was the Four Corners Monument, the flag would be `RUSEC{beauty.reinstate.offend}`.
