## Description
I recently remembered a childhood magazine. I am a forgetful person, and I cannot remember the name of the magazine. This company is a historic civic organization. There is another specific issue of this magazine that is one of my favorites. I remember saying it something about the Olympics, a funny mail burro who loves alfalfa, and something about a “Cheetah Hunt”, whatever that means…Can you please find the ISSN number of this specific magazine issue? This is the first part of the flag.
<br />

I was also reading this very old newspaper, and it mentioned something related to a historic boy-led organization. The newspaper is from one of the three locations where Rutgers currently has their campuses. It mentions some sort of general, named McAlpin, and was published during World War I. He was said to be the President of this organization. Can you give me the name of the newspaper? This is the second part of the flag.
<br />

Once you have found both parts of the flag, you have to format it as follows: `RUSEC{ISSN-1234-5678_NAME-OF-NEWSPAPER}`. The name of the newspaper must be written all in capitals.
