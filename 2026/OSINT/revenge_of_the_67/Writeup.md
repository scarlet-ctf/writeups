* The pistol in the image is a `SE-14 Pistol`
* As per [this wiki entry](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/SE-14_blaster_pistol), it was used by either criminals/smugglers or the Seperatist (Droid) Army (which, given the context, it is the latter)
* There's only a handful of people who are leaders of the Droid Army, but eventually you'll find `General Grievous`.
* Given the mentions of `entries`, and the description mentioning how "servers" (IPv4/IPv6) and "redirects" (CNAME) are gone, leaving only "text" (TXT), we look at `ctf.rusec.club`.
