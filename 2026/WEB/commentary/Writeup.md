`ctf.rusec.club` is a reverse proxy that hosts `rctf`

The default nginx page is available by just not accessing the host `ctf.rusec.club` (I.E: just the ip address)

The landing page you get, "Welcome to nginx!", has the HTML comments:

```html
<!-- you found me :3 --!>
<!-- RUSEC{truly_the_hardest_ctf_challenge} --!>
```
