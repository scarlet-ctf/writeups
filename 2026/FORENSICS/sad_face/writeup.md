Challenge mentions that the flag is hidden in Event Viewer logs and my mentor keeps sending me a blue screen. Indicates that my mentor was sending me a blue screen of death payload. The three Event IDs to investigate are 1001, for rebooting from a bugcheck (smbv1), 41, computer without cleanly shutting down, and 6008, previous system shutdown was unexpected. Inspecting the binary data of these events, you will see that most of them are random garbage. However, exactly one event from each ID group contains a meaningful Base64 string that decodes to a readable partial flag.
