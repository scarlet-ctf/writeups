#
# Classes for Markdown parsing. See python-markdown documentation
# for details. We want to find all top level code blocks (indented
# four spaces in the Markdown), which we'll parse for scenario test
# stuff later on. We create a Python markdown extension and use
# "tree processor" to analyse the parsed ElementTree at the right
# moment for top level <pre> blocks.
#

# This is a Treeprocessor that iterates over the parsed Markdown,
# as an ElementTree, and finds all top level code blocks.
